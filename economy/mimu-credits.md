## How does the economy in Koala Park work?

Koala Park has a certain economy system it uses, powered by Mimu bot. It is an aesthetically pleasing bot that is able to create embeds and allow server economy to exist.

‚ùó _**Server economy is invaluable and priceless. It does not have any real life value and should not be traded for real life money or items that are quite expensive. Koala Park will not endorse these actions as well as take bribes from members. Bribing a Ranger or the Mayor will result in a 1 day timeout.**_

### Getting Started

To get started, all you need to do is join the server. When you join, you get a free amount of 20 coins. To view your balance, `/balance` which will show your overall balance, including your server currency and inventory for your shop items.

As you chat in the channels, you earn money to buy items in the shop. Some items require some roles or give roles. Some are just for cosmetic purposes. To view the shop, you can type `/shop view` to preview the last updated shop.

To buy these items, you can type `/shop buy` to buy the certain item you want to buy. Some items may be marked as emojis, so they will have a large string of text and numbers. Completely ignore the string and just buy it, as it will show up as the emoji when you view your balance.

### Giving Items to Users

Some shop items may only have a limited stock. In this case, the only way to get it is to ask a user to give it to you. Sometimes, it may not be that easy.

A user may ask you to give currency for you to receive the item. Please be vigilant and only take the trade with the user if you trust them. If they do so, please report them so our moderators can sort the problem and revert the changes. You **will get punished** if you try to scam a user on the server.

_**üí° To give an item, type**** ****`/give item`****. To give currency, type**** ****`/give currency`****. Prompts will appear to complete the slash command.**_

### Earning Money Through Events

Sometimes, the server may host events. The events will usually give coins in exchange for participation in the event. The minimum reward for an event is **100 coins.**

Don‚Äôt get this confused with Mimu events. Mimu events are embeds that allow you to claim a certain amount of coins once for absolutely free!
