# ðŸŒ³ Park Credits

If you've been in the server lately, you may have seen that the Mayor and other server members may have been using a bot named Tatsu rather than Mimu.

## Why the sudden change?

While Mimu and Amari may have been good Discord bots to base our levelling and economy system, Tatsu will be a more efficient approach and has a more user-friendly interface, such as the new Discord interactions.

We did like these systems, but it's time to move on to another economy system. The Mayor and The Chief Rangers are also able to change the scale of how much you need to level up and get those perks, as well as doing an easier job for us.

Don't worry, you'll still be able to use Mimu credits and convert your existing Mimu credits to the new Park Credits. Contact an Enforcer or the Mayor to convert these credits. **The conversion rate is 1 Park Credit = 20 Mimu Credits.**

## Where are all the roles and figurines?

Looking for those? You'll find them in the Community Shop, where you'll be able to buy badges/figurines with limited stock and roles that may give you amazing perks.
