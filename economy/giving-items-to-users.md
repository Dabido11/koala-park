# ðŸ“ž Giving Items to Users

### Giving Items to Users

Some shop items may only have a limited stock. In this case, the only way to get it is to ask a user to give it to you. Sometimes, it may not be that easy.

A user may ask you to give currency for you to receive the item. Please be vigilant and only take the trade with the user if you trust them. If they do so, please report them so our moderators can sort the problem and revert the changes. You **will get punished** if you try to scam a user on the server.

_**ðŸ’¡ To give an item, type**** ****`/give item`****. To give currency, type**** ****`/give currency`****. Prompts will appear to complete the slash command.**_
