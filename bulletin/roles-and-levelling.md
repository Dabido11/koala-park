# ðŸŽ­ Roles & Levelling

Koala Park features a levelling system, with rewards such as giving you roles with certain perks that give QoL features to your profile and your overall Discord experience.

## What are roles?

Short story; roles are a set of permission systems that allows you to not only (1) spice up your profile on a certain server but also (2) give you certain permissions on the server that you may not be able to get.

## How does levelling work on Koala Park?

In Koala Park, levelling works by exceeding a fixed threshold to gain another level, which will be automatically done by **AmariBot**. You can gain levels by chatting on the server. The rate of experience given is 1xp/s.

## What are the current roles you can achieve?

You can grab most of these roles through the integrated "Channels & Roles" page in the Discord server?

### Focuses

Focuses are used as a role to mention when there are certain updates on the Discord server.

* **@Server Focus** â¤³ Concerned about the updates on the server but you don't want to get pinged using @everyone every single time? Here's the role for you. :)
* **@Shop Focus** â¤³ Grab this role if you only need to focus on shop updates in the server.
* **@Event Focus** â¤³ Only need to focus on the events in the server? Grab this role.

### Levels

* Level 0 - Default, the basic role you get at the beginning. You get the primary texting features without any restrictions, as well as access to most public channels.
* Level 5 - You're actually chatting, which is pretty good. You get most of the primary features which are; **getting the ability** **to create private threads, make voice messages, and use Soundboard.**
* Level 10 - You're doing way better. You get **image and GIF perms for free, as well as reaching double-digit levels.**
