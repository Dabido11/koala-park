# ðŸ“š Ground Rules

**Welcome to Koala Park!** One of the many community servers that welcomes a thriving community and specialises in bringing groups together. However, we need to set ground rules for everyone to follow.

## Rules

1. It's important to know the @Mayor have the final say in terms of what happens when punishments are to happen. Do not argue or dramatize the situation.
2. Common sense is a key concept that should be implemented everywhere throughout the server, it's self-explanatory. So, don't be annoying.
3. No NSFW or obscene content, keep it "family-friendly". Please keep profanity at a moderate level and no inappropriate content that could get you or everyone else in trouble. We will instantly ban anyone who sends highly inappropriate content and reports will be made.
4. No spamming in the Discord server. This helps reduce channel flood, and is moderated by Wick.
5. Do not scam others with the in-built server economy. Scamming someone is an unpleasant and cruel experience. You will be fairly punished if this takes place.
6. No moderators should abuse their place of power, please report to the **@Mayor** if this happens.

## Punishments

Other than simple time-outs or kicks when deemed necessary, we will not hesitate to use moderated actions that are high in level. Let's outline what can happen when you break these rules. The levels of punishment lower by one level at every **Sunday 12am AEST**. (Yes, this is similar to Valve's CS:GO competitive bans and punishments.)

* **Level 1**. Simple punishments will result in a timeout spanning about 60s - 10m.
* **Level 2**. If rules are broken repeatedly, you may be issued a kick or a timeout spanning 11m - 6d depending on the severity.
* **Level 3**. If the infractions continue, you are timed out for 7 days - 28 days.
* **Level 4.** This level can only be applied by the Mayor or administrators (without the Mastermind role). You will be timed out for more than a month.
* **Level 5**. You will be blacklisted from this server and have a permanent ban.
