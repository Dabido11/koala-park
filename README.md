# üè° Home

Koala Park is an upcoming Discord server that is meant to bring communities together. We have a wide array of features that can help connect many certain groups to help co-exist and create one big community in one server.

## Features

* Multiple channels for socialising
* Streamlined economy systems, with levels, rewards, and shops
* Fair protests and democracy so everyone has a voice in what comes next in the server
* Consistent frequency of tournaments & events
* Recruitment stall channels to advertise and show off different communities & groups, as well as looking for these groups

## Why Koala Park?

Koala Park is a Discord server that helps bring you and your friends together. I know this may seem corny, but imagine a place where you, your friends, and your close one can all socialise together and meet some new interesting people with many other different communities.

Also, we have an active member base at this current moment that is very welcoming, but strange at first. Multiple events are hosted on weekends and semester holidays in Australia. So, please, join the server! It‚Äôs a very nice community to be in even if we have our troubles and doubts.

_**Please keep in mind that our audience is targeted towards the older, more mature userbase. So above the legal age for Discord. If you do not comply with our rules, we may punish you.**_
